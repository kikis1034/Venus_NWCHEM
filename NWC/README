  1.3 Compilation script of VENUS/NWChem (build-venus-nwchem6.1.1.sh)
                    
    An example compilation script is given and named as build-venus-nwchem6.1.1.sh. This script has 
been tested and will work for a Linux machine which has not installed either NWChem or VENUS. Notice 
that the compilation process depends highly on computational environment. Therefore some of the 
settings in the script might need to be changed according to the computer that one wants to have 
VENUS/NWChem run on. In particular, it is advised that one should get NWChem compiled and working 
in parallel correctly in stand alone mode before compiling the VENUS/NWChem package.  Then the options 
used for the standalone compile should be used in the build-venus-nwchem6.1.1.sh file.  Lines in 
the compiling script that possibly need to be modified include (not all) paths to directories 
(source code, math library, etc), choice of compilers, math library and so on.

  1.4 User Manual for VENUS (Manual.doc)

    User Manual of VENUS is also provided and named as Manual.doc. For more information about VENUS/NWChem, please visit https://cdssim.chem.ttu.edu.

2. Instructions on the installation/compilation

    The VENUS/NWChem interface is designed to link the general electronic structure program (NWChem) and classical chemical dynamics simulation program (VENUS) to perform direct dynamics simulation in which the trajectories are integrated on the fly with the potential and its derivatives obtained directly from electronic structure theory.

    VENUS needs to couple with NWChem through the "qm geninterface venus" modules. So for a cluster where NWChem has already been compiled, before compiling VENUS, one needs to export "NWCHEM_MODULES="qm geninterface venus"" and make NWChem again. 
To be more general, an example of compiling VENUS/NWChem on a cluster without NWChem is provided below. 

NWChem version 6.1.1 is used as an example for the compilation.Later versions of NWChem should also be compatible with Venus but earlier versions, i.e. pre 6.1.1, may not.

    The complete compiling processes includes:
     1. Choose the directory you want VENUS/NWChem to be compiled in and untar the distribution file.
     2. Unzip the Nwchem-6.1.1_Feb_27.tar.gz file to obtain the NWChem-6.1.1 source code, 
        the new generated folder is nwchem-6.1.1-src
     3. Modify the compilation script ./build-venus-nwchem6.1.1.sh to match the cluster and directories
        (as described above).
     4. Compile VENUS/NWChem by ./build-venus-nwchem6.1.1.sh
